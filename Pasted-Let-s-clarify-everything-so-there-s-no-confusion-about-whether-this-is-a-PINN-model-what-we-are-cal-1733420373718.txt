Let’s clarify everything so there’s no confusion about whether this is a PINN model, what we are calculating, and how these 6 equations relate to the problem.

1. Is This a PINN Model?
Yes, but it's not a traditional PDE-driven PINN.
PINNs (Physics-Informed Neural Networks) are neural networks trained with physics-based constraints. These constraints can come from:
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), or
Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), algebraic equations, or physical laws.
In your case:

The problem is not directly governed by PDEs like elasticity or fluid dynamics. Instead, the governing equations are algebraic and analytical formulations (e.g., air mass, zenith angle, irradiance).
This means the PDE residual term is not based on gradients of the predicted values (e.g., 
∇
𝐼
∇I).
However, your model is still a PINN because you are enforcing physics-based constraints (e.g., comparing predictions with physical irradiance values).
2. What Are We Solving in Ideal Conditions?
In ideal conditions, the goal is to:

Train a neural network model to predict solar irradiance as a function of inputs (
latitude
,
longitude
,
time
latitude,longitude,time).
Ensure that the predictions are consistent with the 6 governing equations:
Zenith angle (
cos
⁡
(
𝜃
𝑧
)
cos(θ 
z
​
 )),
Air mass (
𝑀
M),
Atmospheric transmission (
𝑇
T),
Cloud effects (removed for ideal conditions),
Terrain effects (slope and aspect),
Spectral irradiance (Planck’s law).
Use these predictions to optimize the solar panel setup (e.g., slope and aspect).
What Will We Calculate?
The physical irradiance (
𝐼

I

​
 ) using the 6 equations and:
Inputs like latitude, longitude, time.
Idealized or universal coefficients.

3. How Is This PINN Model Trained?
Here’s how the PINN model works:

Latitude (
𝜙
ϕ), longitude (
𝜆
λ), time (
𝑡
t).
Model Prediction:
The neural network predicts 
𝐼

Physics-Informed Residual:
The residual is the difference between 
𝐼

​
  and 
𝐼

  (calculated using the 6 equations):

This residual enforces consistency between the model and the governing equations.
Loss Function:
The total loss is based on the residual plus optional boundary/initial conditions or regularization terms.
4. If Gradients Are Not Used, Is It Still a PINN?
Yes, because:

Physics-based constraints are still used.
Traditional PDEs require gradients because their physics is described by spatial/temporal derivatives. In your case, the physics is described by algebraic equations, so gradients are not needed.
The physics constraints are still directly tied to the inputs and outputs of the model.

6. Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE)
The Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) is a complex PDE that models how light propagates through a medium. It is generally used for:

Real-world scenarios involving scattering, absorption, and reflection of light.
Detailed atmospheric models for cloud cover, aerosols, etc.
In Ideal Conditions:
The RTE is not necessary because:
Cloud effects are ignored.
Atmospheric transmission is simplified to an exponential decay model.
The simpler algebraic formulations are sufficient to model solar irradiance under ideal conditions.
