Updated Code Snippets
1. Physical Constants and User-Defined Inputs
Add panel slope and aspect as user inputs and remove unnecessary environmental effects:

python
Copy code
def setup_physical_constants(self):
    # Universal Constants (Verified)
    self.solar_constant = 1367.0  # W/m²
    self.stefan_boltzmann = 5.67e-8  # W/m²K⁴

    # Ideal Clear Sky Parameters
    self.atmospheric_extinction = 0.1  # Clear sky coefficient
    self.air_mass_coefficient = 1.0  # Standard atmosphere

    # User-Defined Panel Parameters
    self.panel_slope = 30.0  # Default tilt in degrees (adjustable by user)
    self.panel_aspect = 180.0  # Default orientation (180° = South-facing)
2. Incorporating Panel Slope and Aspect
Update irradiance calculations to include the cosine of incidence angle based on panel slope and aspect:

python
Copy code
def calculate_cos_incidence(self, solar_zenith, solar_azimuth):
    """
    Calculate cosine of the incidence angle for the solar panel.
    Includes panel slope and aspect.
    """
    panel_slope_rad = jnp.radians(self.panel_slope)
    panel_aspect_rad = jnp.radians(self.panel_aspect)
    solar_zenith_rad = jnp.radians(solar_zenith)
    solar_azimuth_rad = jnp.radians(solar_azimuth)

    cos_incidence = (
        jnp.cos(solar_zenith_rad) * jnp.cos(panel_slope_rad) +
        jnp.sin(solar_zenith_rad) * jnp.sin(panel_slope_rad) * jnp.cos(solar_azimuth_rad - panel_aspect_rad)
    )
    return jnp.clip(cos_incidence, 0, 1)  # Ensure no negative values
3. Updated Irradiance Calculation
Include the updated cos_incidence in the physics-based irradiance calculations:

python
Copy code
def calculate_physics_based_irradiance(self, solar_zenith, solar_azimuth):
    """
    Compute the idealized physics-based irradiance.
    """
    # Top-of-atmosphere irradiance
    I_top = self.solar_constant * jnp.cos(jnp.radians(solar_zenith))

    # Atmospheric transmission
    air_mass = 1 / (jnp.cos(jnp.radians(solar_zenith)) + 0.50572 * (96.07995 - solar_zenith)**(-1.6364))
    transmission = jnp.exp(-self.atmospheric_extinction * air_mass)

    # Panel-adjusted irradiance
    cos_incidence = self.calculate_cos_incidence(solar_zenith, solar_azimuth)
    I_panel = I_top * transmission * cos_incidence

    return I_panel
4. Update PINN Residual
Incorporate cosine of incidence angle and slope/aspect in the PINN residuals to align with the physics-based calculations:

python
Copy code
def pde_residual(model, latitude, longitude, time):
    """
    Compute the residual for the PINN model based on physics equations.
    """
    # Solar zenith and azimuth (simplified for idealized conditions)
    solar_zenith = model.calculate_solar_zenith(latitude, time)
    solar_azimuth = model.calculate_solar_azimuth(latitude, longitude, time)

    # Physics-based irradiance
    I_physics = model.calculate_physics_based_irradiance(solar_zenith, solar_azimuth)

    # PINN prediction
    I_pinn = model(latitude, longitude, time)

    # PDE residual
    residual = jnp.mean((I_pinn - I_physics)**2)

    return residual
5. Simplify Loss Function
Simplify the loss function to focus on ideal conditions with user-defined slope and aspect:

python
Copy code
def loss_fn(model, latitude, longitude, time):
    """
    Compute loss based on physics-based and PINN-predicted irradiance.
    """
    # PINN prediction
    I_pinn = model(latitude, longitude, time)

    # Physics-based calculation
    solar_zenith = model.calculate_solar_zenith(latitude, time)
    solar_azimuth = model.calculate_solar_azimuth(latitude, longitude, time)
    I_physics = model.calculate_physics_based_irradiance(solar_zenith, solar_azimuth)

    # Loss based on difference
    return jnp.mean((I_pinn - I_physics)**2)
Mistakes and Fixes
Mistakes Identified
Missing Panel Slope/Aspect Integration:

Previous implementation didn’t include slope and aspect in physics-based or PINN calculations.
Unnecessary Terrain Effects:

Environmental terrain effects added unnecessary complexity.
Improper Atmospheric Transmission Coefficients:

Coefficients weren’t idealized properly for clear-sky conditions.
Corrections
Integrated panel slope and aspect into both PINN and physics-based calculations.
Removed unnecessary environmental terrain effects.
Simplified atmospheric transmission for idealized conditions.
Next Steps
Implement and verify these changes.
Test the model under ideal conditions with user-defined inputs for slope and aspect.
Gradually add real-world conditions (e.g., cloud effects) once the ideal model performs accurately.
